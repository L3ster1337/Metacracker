# Metacracker
MetaCracker is a tool used for editing metadata of PDF files and image files. This initial version is primarily focused on PDF files, as this module is more developed. However, its mode of operation is simple: To edit, press "Ctrl + N" and it will enable the editing mode, followed by pressing "Esc" and ":q!" to exit the program without saving, or ":x" to exit with saving enabled.

#Updates
